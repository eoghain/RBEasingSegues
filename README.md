RBEasingSegues
==============
A collection of segues that utilize the AHEasing library to add smoother transitions between views.
--------------

This collection stands on the backs of Warren Moore (AHEasing) and Evande Wu whose work is shamelessly copied and used to make my life easier when dealing with animated transitions.

Goals
-----

To supply a collection of ready made Segues to make applications feel more alive.  Allowing users to differientate their applications from the standard iOS animations.
